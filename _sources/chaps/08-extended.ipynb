    "We learned 2-D background estimations using ``photutils`` and ``sep``, which are mere pyhonically ported SExtractor. The goal of SExtractor is, as explained earlier, to extract arbitrary source (star, galaxy, ...) in the image.\n",

    "Here we will explore this **source extraction** part of them. \n",

    "Before proceed, I expect you to read and follow the documentations and tutorials of\n",
    "1. [photutils/Image Segmentation](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/segmentation.html) \n",
    "    * Image convolution and source detection\n",
    "    * Source deblending\n",
    "    * `SourceCatalog` class & extended source photometry\n",

    "    * This is the implementation of STSDAS.ISOPHOT.ELLIPSE package into python by Ivo Busko.\n",
    "    * If you are planning on doing research on galaxies, you may also want to have a look at [additional notebooks](https://photutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/isophote.html#additional-example-notebooks-online). Note that these are last updated in Jan. 2021, so some code lines will not work properly. \n",
