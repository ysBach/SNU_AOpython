# An Example Syllabus

This is an example case of syllabus.

````{warning}
* The **lecturer** should prepare PCs (i.e., **install python and necessary packages**) before the class.

```{note}
:class: dropdown
There are multiple explanations about installation in the prerequisites notes, but they are mere "help pages" when students have to setup their own env by themselves in the future (e.g., when they become a PhD student). Please do **NOT** attempt to let students go through all the installation processes, unless it is absolutely necessary.
```
````

```{warning}
My intention is to give lectures using this website.

I did **NOT** intend to let students git pull this repo!
```

* This lecture note is ignoring anything about preprocessing. If preprocessing-related lecture is required, I recommend using [Matthew Craig's CCD Data Reduction Guide](https://www.astropy.org/ccd-reduction-and-photometry-guide/v/dev/notebooks/00-00-Preface.html).

1. Preparation
    * Introduce [Software tools](00:Softwares), [python environments](00:Prepare_Python), and [UNIX commands](00:UNIX). Focus on:
        * What tools/packages they will use.
        * For what each of them will be used.
    * Give short lectures on the four notebooks in [python prep](00:python_prep).
    * [HW](HW:swtools)
        * Slack, GitHub are optional.
        * DS9 and Interactive Analyses parts are likely useful.

2. Week 01:
    * Dealing with FITS (astropy)
    * Simple centering algorithm lecture.
